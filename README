Bash scripts for running Apache Tomcat. Tomcat 6.0.x is tested. Other versions may work.

The following features are provided:

* Process management - easily start, stop, restart, and kill the running server
* Application management - easily list, deploy, undeploy, start, and stop running web application

If .../bin/../.tomcat is readable, it will source this file at the start of each script (possibly multiple times, so this script must be idempotent).

Required environment variables

CATALINA_BASE - See Tomcat docs
CATALINA_HOME - See Tomcat docs
CATALINA_PID - See Tomcat docs
